The cursor class
====================

.. class:: mariadb.cursor

  Cursors can be used to execute SQL commands within a database session. Cursors
  objects are created by the :func:`cursor` method.

  Cursors are bound to the connection for their entire lifetime. If a connection was
  closed or dropped all cursor objects bound to this connection became invalid.

  To check if a cursor is still valid, the :data:`~closed` attribute needs to be checked.

Cursor methods
--------------

.. method:: callproc(procname, [ args]))

  Executes a stored procedure. 

  Input/Output or Output parameters have to be retrieved by .fetch methods,
  the :data:`~sp_outparams` attribute indicates if the result set contains output
  parameters.

  :param procname: The name of the stored procedure
  :type procname: string
  :param args: A sequence which must contain an entry for each parameter the procedure expects.
  :type args: sequence

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python 

    >>>cursor.execute("CREATE PROCEDURE p1(IN i1 VAR  CHAR(20), OUT o2 VARCHAR(40))"
                      "BEGIN"
                      "  SELECT 'hello'"
                      "  o2:= 'test'"
                      "END")
    >>>cursor.callproc('p1', ('foo', 0))
    >>> cursor.sp_outparams
    False
    >>> cursor.fetchone()
    ('hello',)
    >>> cursor.nextset()
    True
    >>> cursor.sp_outparams
    True
    >>> cursor.fetchone()
    ('test',)

.. method:: execute(statement[, data [, buffered=False])

  Executes a SQL statement.

  Parameters in SQL statement may be provided as sequence or mapping and will be bound
  to variables in the operation. Variables are specified as question
  marks (paramstyle='qmark'), however for compatibility reasons |MCP|
  also supports the 'format' and 'pyformat' paramstyles
  with the restriction, that different paramstyles can't be mixed within.
  a statement

  :param statement: SQL statement
  :type procname: string
  :param args: A sequence which must contain an entry for each parameter the statement expects.
  :type args: sequence
       
  A reference to the operation will be retained by the cursor.
  If the cursor was created with attribute prepared=True the statement
  string for following execute operations will be ignored:
  This is most effective for algorithms where the same operation is used,
  but different parameters are bound to it (many times).

  By default result sets will not be buffered, so further operations on the
  same connection will fail, unless the entire result set was read. For buffering
  the entire result set an additional parameter *buffered=True* must be specified.



.. method:: executemany(statement, data)
   
  Exactly behaves like .execute() but accepts a list of tuples, where each
  tuple represents data of a row within a table.
  .executemany() only supports DML (insert, update, delete, replace) statements.

  :param statement: A DML SQL statement
  :type statement: string
  :param data: Data to be used for place holders

  The following example will insert 3 rows:

  .. code-block:: python 

    data= [
        (1, 'Michael', 'Widenius')
        (2, 'Diego', 'Dupin')
        (3, 'Lawrin', 'Novitsky')
    ]
    cursor.executemany("INSERT INTO colleagues VALUES (?, ?, ?)", data)

  To insert special values like NULL or a column default, you need to specify indicators:

  - mariadb.indicator_null is used for NULL values
  - mariadb.indicator_ignore is used to skip update of a column.
  - mariadb.indicator_default is used for a default value (insert/update)
  - mariadb.indicator_row is used to skip update/insert of the entire row.

  .. note::

    - All values for a column must have the same data type.
    - Indicators can only be used when connecting to a MariaDB Server 10.2 or newer. Older versions of MariaDB and MySQL servers don't support this feature.


.. method:: fetchall()

  Fetches all rows of a pending result set and returns a list of tuples.

  If the cursor was created with option *named_tuple=True* the result will be a list of named tuples.

.. method:: fetchmany(size)

  Fetch the next set of rows of a query result, returning a list of tuples
  An empty list is returned when no more rows are available.

  :param size:  The number of rows to fetch per call. If it is not given, the cursor's arraysize determines the number of rows to be fetched.
  :type size: integer

  If the cursor was created with option *named_tuple=True* the result will be a list of named tuples.

.. method:: fetchone()

  Fetches next row of a pending result set and returns a tuple.

  If the cursor was created with option *named_tuple=True* the result will be a named tuple.

.. method:: fieldcount()

  Returns the number of fields (columns) within a result set.

.. method:: next()

  Return the next row from the currently executing SQL statement
  using the same semantics as fetchone().

.. method:: nextset()

  Will make the cursor skip to the next available result set,
  discarding any remaining rows from the current set.

.. method:: scroll(value[, mode='relative'])

  Scroll the cursor in the result set to a new position according to mode.

  :param value: New position in the result set
  :type value: integer
  :param mode: Scroll mode, posslible values are 'absolute' or 'relative'. Defaults to 'relative'.
  :type mode: string

  If mode is relative, value is taken as offset to the current
  position in the result set, if set to absolute, value states an absolute
  target position. 

.. method: setinputsizes()

  Required by PEP-249. Does nothing in MariaDB Connector/Python

.. method: setoutputsize()

  Required by PEP-249. Does nothing in MariaDB Connector/Python

-----------------
Cursor attributes
-----------------

.. data:: arraysize

  This read/write attribute specifies the number of rows to fetch at a time with .fetchmany(). It defaults to 1 meaning to fetch a single row at a time

.. data:: buffered

  When set to *True* all result sets are immediately transferred and the connection
  between client and server is no longer blocked. Default value is False.

.. data:: closed

  Indicates if the cursor is closed (e.g. if connection dropped) and can't be reused.

.. data:: connection

  Returns a reference to the connection object on which the cursor was created.

.. data:: description

  This read-only attribute is a sequence of 7-item sequences.

  Each of these sequences contains information describing one result column:

  - name
  - type_code
  - display_size
  - internal_size
  - precision
  - scale
  - null_ok

  This attribute will be None for operations that do not return rows or if the cursor has
  not had an operation invoked via the .execute*() method yet 

.. data:: lastrowid

  This read only attribute of the ID generated by a query on a table with a column having
  the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute or the value for the last usage of
  LAST_INSERT_ID(expr). If the last query wasn't an INSERT or UPDATE
  statement or if the modified table does not have a column with the
  AUTO_INCREMENT attribute and LAST_INSERT_ID was not used, the returned
  value will be zero

.. data:: sp_outparams

  This read-only attribute undicates if the current result set contains in/out
  or out parameters from a previously executed stored procedure.

.. data:: rowcount

  This read-only attribute specifies the number of rows that the last
  execute*() produced (for DQL statements like SELECT) or affected
  (for DML statements like UPDATE or INSERT).

  The return value is -1 in case no .execute*() has been performed
  on the cursor or the rowcount of the last operation cannot be
  determined by the interface.

  For unbuffered cursors (default) the exact number of rows can only be determined after all rows were fetched.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> cursor=conn.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    -1
    >>> rows= cursor.fetchall()
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    1
    >>> cursor=conn.cursor(buffered=True)
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    1


.. data:: statement

  This ready only attribute returns the last executed SQL statement.

.. data:: warnings

  Returns the number of warnings from the last executed statement, or zero
  if there are no warnings.

  .. note::

    If SQL_MODE TRADITIONAL is enabled an error instead of a warning will be returned. To retrieve warnings use the cursor method execute("SHOW WARNINGS").
